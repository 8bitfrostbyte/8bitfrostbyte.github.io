# GameJam Day 3: The Finale

So it's the final day of the GameJam.

I got into the lab for 10am, downtrodden and very tired from my coding mishap the night before and with only one of my teammates present I was determined to get something done by the 6pm deadline.
After the issues last night i had an idea, knowing that there was a chance that I wouldn’t be able to get the push and pull mechanic working for the player, i had decided to test if my simple code for grabbing and throwing could be used in a similar way using mass and gravity to simulate a heavier object.

This would allow all the player functionality to be completed without overcomplicating the process. However, this didn’t work, I tried multiple different things to make it work but I was unsuccessful.
This lead me back to my original idea from last night but this time I was around a few people so I could do something I couldn’t do while sat at home…

Ask for help.

So I did exactly that and finally figured out how to get the correct input mapping. It turns out, I forgot to map axis inputs in the project settings. Having figured this out, I set to work redoing all the programming I had failed at getting to function last night.

So having fixed input mapping and knowing I had 7 hours to implement base functionality for the mechanic and the game world interactable objects before the deadline…

I moved to the testing level and got to work as quickly as I could, all I had to do was repeat what I talked about on day 2 of the game jam and hopefully this time it would work.

After 3 hours of work I had finally completed the code necessary to allow the player to move the heavier objects. Though it was a little jittery, it worked well enough for me to consider the task completed which meant I could move on to other less important tasks.
Meanwhile, my other team members were hard at work doing asset allocation and finally adding textures to the blocked out levels. The level designer told me that we were scrapping the third level due to lack of time and after agreeing I began looking into the next task which just so happened to be the smaller interactable objects within the game world.

However, while I was doing that problems were arising, the GitHub repository had issues with pushing and pulling from origin and after some time and a lot of trial and error to figure things out we got everything fixed.

This however was not our only problem, the university was stuck using Unreal Engine 5.2.1 and had been for some time. As a result when assets were collected they were for a different version of Unreal Engine. Unknown to us at the time was the fact that those assets could not be properly imported into our group project leading to a large amount of our needed assets being unusable and missing. This hindered our progress and with time running increasingly short we tried everything to collect as many usable assets as possible.

Ultimately however, with the core of our project complete and not enough time left to truly implement the vision we had, we collectively decided as a group to submit our project early and concede the GameJam to the other teams.
With that we headed home tired and only partially happy with what we had accomplished in the short three day time span.

While the event itself was a great learning experience and taught me a lot more about understanding Unreal Engine and its many interesting features as well as giving me a short prototype to add to my portfolio, I will admit that the limitations and restrictions imposed by the people running the GameJam and the out of date software we were all forced to use made organising, planning and executing our idea to its full potential very difficult and complex.

Ultimately while I enjoyed my time I believe that had we been given fewer limitations and a larger deadline we would have improved our chances of being able to fully realise the vision we had for our 2025 GameJam project.
With our project fully submitted…
